  <para>Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much
  success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

  <para revision="systemd">Create an <filename>/etc/os-release</filename> 
        file required by systemd:</para>

<screen revision="systemd"><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/os-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
NAME="Linux From Scratch"

ID=lfs
PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch &versiond;"

  <para revision="sysv">It may be a good idea to create an
  <filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename> file. By having this file, it is very
  easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some point) to find
  out which LFS version is installed on the system. Create this file by
  running:</para>

<screen revision="sysv"><userinput>echo &version; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>

  <para revision="systemd">Creating the file
  <filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename> is recommended for compatibility with
  the non-systemd branch. By having this file, it is very easy for you (and for
  us if you need to ask for help at some point) to find out which LFS version
  is installed on the system. Create this file by running:</para>

<screen revision="systemd"><userinput>echo &versiond; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>

  <para>It is also a good idea to create a file to show the status of your
  new system with respect to the Linux Standards Base (LSB).  To create
  this file, run:</para>

<screen revision="sysv"><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/lsb-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="&version;"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
EOF</userinput></screen>

<screen revision="systemd"><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/lsb-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="&versiond;"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>Be sure to put some sort of customization for the field
  'DISTRIB_CODENAME' to make the system uniquely yours.</para>
